## Language policy

- **Conversation with the user: Japanese.**
- **Everything else: English.** This includes code, identifiers, comments, docstrings,
  documentation, commit messages, CLI messages, log output, test names, and Web UI strings.
- Do not mix Japanese into source files or docs, even in comments.

## Model / cost policy

Fable and Opus are very expensive. Delegate work to cheaper models via subagents:

- **Simple investigation** (locating code, summarizing a file/library, checking a format spec,
  routine web lookups): spawn a subagent with `model: "haiku"`.
- **Simple implementation** (boilerplate, a well-specified function, straightforward tests,
  format readers following an existing pattern, mechanical refactors): spawn a subagent with
  `model: "sonnet"`.
- Reserve the main (expensive) model for architecture decisions, numerical-algorithm design and
  debugging, fitting/optimization logic, and anything with subtle correctness requirements.
- When a task decomposes into several independent simple parts, run the cheap subagents in
  parallel.

## Project overview

**AutoCircuit** analyzes frequency-characteristic (impedance) data of passive components and
extracts equivalent circuit models.

Two modes:
1. **Manual topology**: the user supplies an equivalent circuit; AutoCircuit fits all parameters
   **without any user-supplied initial values** (global optimization; this is the key
   differentiator vs. ZView).
2. **Full auto**: both the circuit topology and its parameters are discovered automatically,
   reported as an accuracy-versus-complexity Pareto front plus equivalence classes — never as
   a single "the answer", because different topologies are frequently exact
   reparameterisations of one another. Currently a genetic search; being replaced by
   exhaustive enumeration up to 5 elements (see `docs/DISCOVERY_V2_PLAN.md`).

Other pillars: full ZView-equivalent element set plus skin-effect and Maxwell-Wagner support,
SPICE netlist export (with RC/RL ladder synthesis for fractional elements), readers for common
instrument formats (ZView/Solartron, Keysight CSV, Touchstone, generic CSV), CLI first, then a
static-site Web UI running the same core via WASM (Pyodide).

### Start here

1. `docs/HANDOFF.md` — current state, environment quirks, and the hard-won facts that must not
   be re-derived or accidentally "fixed".
2. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — the overall design. Claims marked **[measured]** are
   backed by `benchmarks/`; do not contradict them without re-running the benchmark.
3. `docs/DISCOVERY_V2_PLAN.md` — the approved next task (exhaustive-first topology discovery).

Update these when decisions change.

## Stack and conventions

- Python >= 3.11, package name `autocircuit`, layout `src/autocircuit/`.
- Tooling: `pytest`, `ruff` (lint + format), `mypy` (strict on core modules). Install with
  `pip install -e .` (`uv` is not available on this machine).
- **`numpy` and `scipy` are the only runtime dependencies, and that is a hard rule** — it is
  what lets the same wheel run under Pyodide in the browser. The CLI therefore uses stdlib
  `argparse`, not `typer`/`click`. Do not add a runtime dependency without changing this file.
- No file-dialog/GUI/OS-specific code anywhere in `autocircuit.core`.
- All angular frequency internally: `omega = 2 * pi * f` in rad/s; data files store Hz.
- Impedance is `complex128` numpy arrays throughout; never split re/im into separate paths.
- Every circuit element implements the same interface (impedance function, parameter metadata
  with units/bounds/log-scale flag, SPICE synthesis hook).
- Tests: every element gets an analytic-value test; every fitter feature gets a synthetic-data
  round-trip test (generate from known circuit + noise, recover within tolerance).
