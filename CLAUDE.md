## Language policy

- **Conversation with the user: Japanese.**
- **Everything else: English.** This includes code, identifiers, comments, docstrings,
  documentation, commit messages, CLI messages, log output, test names, and Web UI strings.
- Do not mix Japanese into source files or docs, even in comments.

## Model / cost policy

Fable and Opus are very expensive. Delegate work to cheaper models via subagents:

- **Simple investigation** (locating code, summarizing a file/library, checking a format spec,
  routine web lookups): spawn a subagent with `model: "haiku"`.
- **Simple implementation** (boilerplate, a well-specified function, straightforward tests,
  format readers following an existing pattern, mechanical refactors): spawn a subagent with
  `model: "sonnet"`.
- Reserve the main (expensive) model for architecture decisions, numerical-algorithm design and
  debugging, fitting/optimization logic, and anything with subtle correctness requirements.
- When a task decomposes into several independent simple parts, run the cheap subagents in
  parallel.

## Project overview

**AutoCircuit** analyzes frequency-characteristic (impedance) data of passive components and
extracts equivalent circuit models.

Three modes, which differ only in how much of the topology the user fixes:
1. **Manual topology**: the user supplies the whole equivalent circuit; AutoCircuit fits all
   parameters **without any user-supplied initial values** (global optimization; this is the key
   differentiator vs. ZView).
2. **Partial topology** (implemented, gates measured; see `docs/PARTIAL_TOPOLOGY_PLAN.md`):
   the user supplies a *skeleton* — the
   part they already know is there, such as a series ESR/ESL on a capacitor or an electrolyte
   resistance on a cell — and the search adds the remaining elements. The candidate space is
   defined generatively, as every topology that reduces to the skeleton once the added elements
   are removed, so it is enumerated by growing the skeleton rather than by filtering the full
   space. (A skeleton is a *constraint*; `discover(seeds=...)` is a *hint* that merely adds
   circuits to the candidate list. They are not the same feature, and a seed that does not
   contain the skeleton is an error rather than a silent choice between them.)
3. **Full auto**: both the circuit topology and its parameters are discovered automatically,
   reported as an accuracy-versus-complexity Pareto front plus equivalence classes — never as
   a single "the answer", because different topologies are frequently exact
   reparameterisations of one another. Exhaustive enumeration up to 5 elements, with the
   genetic search as a fallback above that (see `docs/DISCOVERY_V2_PLAN.md`).

**A user-supplied constraint narrows what the report is allowed to claim, and saying so is not
optional.** Mode 2 is the same shape as two failures this project has already measured — a
screening budget that drops the truth while its equivalents stay on the shortlist, and a DRT
peak count that would delete the right answer from a search still calling itself exhaustive
(`docs/HANDOFF.md` §3, `docs/DISCOVERY_V2_PLAN.md` §3.4). In all three the report still *looks*
healthy. So a constrained search must state its constraint in `complete_up_to`'s sentence
("every plausible topology up to N elements **that contains this skeleton**"), and must report
which equivalence-class members the skeleton excluded: choosing between forms the data cannot
distinguish is something the user did, never a finding.

Other pillars: full ZView-equivalent element set plus skin-effect and Maxwell-Wagner support,
SPICE netlist export (with RC/RL ladder synthesis for fractional elements), readers for common
instrument formats (ZView/Solartron, Keysight CSV, Touchstone, generic CSV), CLI first, then a
static-site Web UI running the same core via WASM (Pyodide).

### Start here

1. `docs/HANDOFF.md` — current state, environment quirks, and the hard-won facts that must not
   be re-derived or accidentally "fixed".
2. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — the overall design. Claims marked **[measured]** are
   backed by `benchmarks/`; do not contradict them without re-running the benchmark.
3. `docs/DISCOVERY_V2_PLAN.md` — exhaustive-first topology discovery. **Implemented**; kept
   because its corrections record why several obvious-looking choices are wrong.
4. `docs/PARTIAL_TOPOLOGY_PLAN.md` — skeleton-constrained discovery (mode 2 above).
   **Implemented; gates P1–P4 measured.** Its §3 is the part that matters — what a constrained
   search is allowed to claim — and §3.2 is where a guess was replaced by a measurement: a
   wrong skeleton is invisible in the residuals and in chi², and surfaces only as an asserted
   element the fit had to switch off.
5. `docs/WEB_UI_PLAN.md` — phase 6, web UI. **Steps 1–4 done and measured** (a lossless
   `FitResult` across a worker boundary, so the browser fans out both tiers, 287 s → 123 s; the
   Data screen, whose Lin-KK verdicts match the CLI's digit for digit; the Fit screen, whose
   fits match the CLI's to every reported digit — gate W1; and the Discover screen, whose search
   matches the CLI's front row for row — gates W2 and W4); **steps 5–6 are a draft awaiting
   approval.** Its §2.3 is where a browser contradicted a number taken from Node, §2.4 is
   where a measurement retired an assumption the transport had been designed around (a fit is
   *not* bit-reproducible across interpreters, only its reported digits are), and §2.5 is where
   a measurement showed one clause of a gate to be unachievable — tier-2 progress cannot stream
   once a second, because one refit takes several — and the gate was rewritten around what was
   measured rather than quietly reinterpreted.

Update these when decisions change.

## Stack and conventions

- Python >= 3.12, package name `autocircuit`, layout `src/autocircuit/`.
- Tooling: `pytest`, `ruff` (lint + format), `mypy` (strict on core modules). Install with
  `pip install -e .` (`uv` is not available on this machine).
- **`numpy` and `scipy` are the only runtime dependencies, and that is a hard rule** — it is
  what lets the same wheel run under Pyodide in the browser. The CLI therefore uses stdlib
  `argparse`, not `typer`/`click`. Do not add a runtime dependency without changing this file.
- No file-dialog/GUI/OS-specific code anywhere in `autocircuit.core`.
- All angular frequency internally: `omega = 2 * pi * f` in rad/s; data files store Hz.
- Impedance is `complex128` numpy arrays throughout; never split re/im into separate paths.
- Every circuit element implements the same interface (impedance function, parameter metadata
  with units/bounds/log-scale flag, SPICE synthesis hook).
- Tests: every element gets an analytic-value test; every fitter feature gets a synthetic-data
  round-trip test (generate from known circuit + noise, recover within tolerance).
